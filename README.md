# Boring Detector

A state-of-the-art detector of Boring hats. Developed at MIT to solve the global challenge (implicitly posed) by Elon
Musk of awarding 10 Boring hat owners a Boring tour. Given that 50,000 hats (current sale estimates) cover only 0.001%
of heads, an automated method for Boring hat detection is needed. 

## Features

### v1.0.0

* Detect Boring hats (including localization of multiple instances).
* Classify not Boring hats.
